# Homework 6
Contained within this repository is a single zip file, which when uncompressed contains a database dump. You restore that database to your personal system by running:
```bash
psql -f hw6.sql
```
from the terminal or command line. Doing so will automatically generate all the needed tables and relationships in a new `hw6` database on your local system. If this step is causing you any issues, _please reach out and let me know so that we can get things sorted out quickly_!

Ensure that what you upload back to the repository for your submission includes both your answers to the questions, any necessary SQL commands for how you arrived at those answers, and your visualizations.
