# Homework 6
Contained within this repository is a zip file (`hw6.zip`), which when uncompressed contains two versions of a database dump. You restore that database schema to your personal system by running:
```bash
psql -d analysis -U username -f hw6_fast.sql
```
from the terminal or command line. Doing so will automatically generate all the needed tables and relationships in a new `hw6` schema in your local `analysis` database. If this step is causing you any issues, _please reach out and let me know so that we can get things sorted out quickly_!

Problems 1 and 2 have template files already included in this repository, and you would just need to additionally upload what images you create for Problem 2. Problem 3 will require you to upload images of your database ER diagrams for each step of the normalization process.
